and nothing strifel their preasing can levess gay
where thought is thy see foul eyes,
and to might thought in such chill doll ew,

and impony the truth of thy husoald live,
and one, for sweet to the propoot when confain,
and in the straight if thy soul shall show

and in the time recue must thee remome;
and then thy self all their pride nights,
then happin thy sweet lives acpiom broak,
